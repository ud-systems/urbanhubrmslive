# Tab Switching White Screen Fix

## Problem Description
When users switch between browser tabs, they were experiencing a white screen before the application would load. This was caused by the React app being unloaded when the tab becomes hidden and not properly restoring state when the tab becomes visible again.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Browser Tab Lifecycle**: When a tab becomes hidden, browsers may unload or suspend React applications to save memory
2. **State Restoration Timing**: The existing state restoration was too slow and didn't handle immediate tab switching
3. **Missing Loading States**: No visual feedback during state restoration, causing white screens
4. **Race Conditions**: Auth context and route restoration weren't properly coordinated

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced State Persistence System
**File**: `src/lib/statePersistence.ts`

**Key Improvements**:
- Added `immediateStateRestoration()` method for instant state recovery
- Implemented `beforeunload` event handler to save state before tab unload
- Added `isRestoring` flag to prevent duplicate restoration attempts
- Enhanced visibility change handlers for immediate response

**New Features**:
```typescript
// Immediate state restoration for tab switching
private immediateStateRestoration(): void {
  if (this.isRestoring) return;
  
  try {
    this.isRestoring = true;
    const savedState = this.loadState({ silent: true });
    
    if (savedState && savedState.currentRoute) {
      const currentRoute = window.location.pathname + window.location.search;
      
      if (currentRoute !== savedState.currentRoute) {
        window.history.replaceState(null, '', savedState.currentRoute);
        window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('immediateStateRestored', { 
          detail: savedState 
        }));
      }
    }
  } finally {
    this.isRestoring = false;
  }
}
```

### 2. App Loader Component
**File**: `src/components/AppLoader.tsx`

**Purpose**: Prevents white screens by showing a loading state during state restoration

**Features**:
- Shows loading spinner during auth loading and state restoration
- Handles tab visibility changes
- Provides smooth transitions between states
- Prevents flash of white screen

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const AppLoader: React.FC<AppLoaderProps> = ({ children }) => {
  const { loading: authLoading } = useAuth();
  const [isRestoring, setIsRestoring] = useState(false);
  const [showLoader, setShowLoader] = useState(true);

  // Show loader if auth is loading, state is restoring, or initial loading
  if (authLoading || isRestoring || showLoader) {
    return (
      <div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 via-blue-50/30 to-slate-50 flex items-center justify-center">
        <div className="text-center">
          <LoadingSpinner size="lg" />
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
            {isRestoring ? 'Restoring your session...' : 'Loading...'}
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return <>{children}</>;
};
```

### 3. Enhanced App Component
**File**: `src/App.tsx`

**Improvements**:
- Added immediate state restoration on tab visibility change
- Integrated AppLoader to prevent white screens
- Added event listeners for state restoration events
- Implemented initial state restoration check

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleVisibilityChange = () => {
    if (!document.hidden) {
      // When tab becomes visible, force state restoration
      statePersistence.forceRestoration();
    }
  };

  document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
  
  // Initial state restoration check
  const savedState = statePersistence.loadState({ key: 'urbanhub-app-state', silent: true });
  if (savedState?.currentRoute) {
    const currentRoute = window.location.pathname + window.location.search;
    if (currentRoute !== savedState.currentRoute) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        window.history.replaceState(null, '', savedState.currentRoute);
      }, 100);
    }
  }

  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
  };
}, []);
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Suppression
**File**: `src/lib/errorSuppressor.ts`

**Updates**:
- Added suppression for immediate state restoration logs
- Enhanced log patterns to reduce console noise
- Maintained important error visibility

## How It Works

### Tab Switching Flow
1. **Tab Hidden**: `beforeunload` event saves current state
2. **Tab Visible**: `visibilitychange` event triggers immediate restoration
3. **State Check**: App checks for saved route and restores if needed
4. **Loading State**: AppLoader shows during restoration process
5. **Smooth Transition**: User sees loading spinner instead of white screen

### State Restoration Process
1. **Immediate Check**: On tab visibility, immediately check for saved state
2. **Route Restoration**: If saved route differs from current, restore it
3. **Event Dispatch**: Trigger custom events for components to respond
4. **Loading Feedback**: Show appropriate loading messages
5. **Smooth Recovery**: Transition back to the saved application state

## Benefits

1. **No More White Screens**: Users see loading states instead of blank screens
2. **Instant Recovery**: State restoration happens immediately on tab switch
3. **Better UX**: Smooth transitions and appropriate loading messages
4. **Reliable State**: State is saved before tab unload and restored on visibility
5. **Cross-Tab Support**: State synchronization across multiple tabs

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Navigate to any page (e.g., Student Portal)
2. Switch to another browser tab
3. Switch back to the application tab
4. Should see loading spinner briefly, then return to the same page
5. No white screen should appear

### Expected Behavior
- **Tab Switch**: Brief loading spinner with "Restoring your session..." message
- **Page Refresh**: Brief loading spinner with "Loading..." message
- **No White Screens**: Always shows loading state during transitions
- **State Preservation**: Returns to exact same page and state

## Performance Considerations

- **Minimal Overhead**: State operations are silent and optimized
- **Fast Restoration**: Immediate state checks prevent delays
- **Memory Efficient**: State is stored locally and cleaned up automatically
- **Production Ready**: All debugging logs are suppressed in production

## Future Enhancements

1. **State Compression**: Compress large state objects for better performance
2. **Selective Persistence**: Allow components to opt-out of persistence
3. **State Analytics**: Track restoration patterns for optimization
4. **Offline Support**: Handle state restoration when offline
